 Introduction 
Often used to illustrate fundamental AI ideas, Tic Tac Toe is a straightforward, deterministic, 
turn-based strategic game. The aim is to create an artificial intelligence agent capable of 
efficiently fighting against human or random opponent and that which performs optimum, 
therefore guaranteeing it never loses. Implementing the Minimax method with Alpha-Beta 
pruning helps the agent improve computational efficiency and replicate adversarial decision
making.
